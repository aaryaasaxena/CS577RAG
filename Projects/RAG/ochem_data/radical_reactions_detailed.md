# ðŸ§ª Radical Reactions in Organic Chemistry

Radical reactions are a fundamental class of mechanisms in organic chemistry, involving species that contain **unpaired electrons** (radicals). These reactions often proceed through **chain mechanisms** and are common in halogenations, polymerizations, and certain selective transformations.

## ðŸ”¹ What Are Radicals?

- A **radical** is a molecule or atom with an **unpaired valence electron**.
- Radicals are **highly reactive** due to the desire to pair their lone electron.
- Often generated via **homolytic cleavage** of a bond (e.g. Cl2 â†’ 2 Clâ€¢).

### Notation:
- Radicals are represented by a **single dot (â€¢)** next to the atom.
- Example: Clâ€¢, CH3â€¢

## ðŸ”¹ General Mechanism of Radical Chain Reactions

Radical reactions typically follow three stages:

### 1. **Initiation**
- Radicals are **generated from stable molecules**.
- Requires **heat, light (hv)**, or a radical initiator (like AIBN or peroxides).
  
**Example:**
```text
Cl2 â†’ 2 Clâ€¢   (via hv)
```

### 2. **Propagation**
- Radicals **react with stable molecules**, generating **new radicals** and **products**.
- This stage is the **core of the reaction chain**.

### 3. **Termination**
- Two radicals **combine to form a stable molecule**, ending the chain.

**Example:**
```text
CH3â€¢ + Clâ€¢ â†’ CH3Cl
```

## ðŸ”¹ Important Radical Reactions

### 1. **Halogenation of Alkanes**

#### Example: Chlorination of Methane
```text
CH4 + Cl2 â†’ CH3Cl + HCl
```

#### Mechanism:

1. **Initiation**:
   - Cl2 â†’ 2 Clâ€¢ (light or heat)

2. **Propagation**:
   - Clâ€¢ + CH4 â†’ CH3â€¢ + HCl
   - CH3â€¢ + Cl2 â†’ CH3Cl + Clâ€¢

3. **Termination**:
   - Clâ€¢ + Clâ€¢ â†’ Cl2
   - CH3â€¢ + Clâ€¢ â†’ CH3Cl
   - CH3â€¢ + CH3â€¢ â†’ C2H6

### Selectivity:
- Bromination is **more selective** than chlorination.
- Tertiary C-H bonds are more reactive than secondary or primary.

---

### 2. **Allylic Bromination (NBS Reaction)**

- Uses **N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)** to generate Brâ€¢ radicals.
- Selectively brominates **allylic** positions (next to C=C).
- **Initiated** by peroxides or UV light.

#### Mechanism:
1. Brâ€¢ abstracts allylic H â†’ allyl radical
2. Allyl radical reacts with Br2 â†’ allylic bromide + Brâ€¢

#### Example:
```text
Cyclohexene + NBS â†’ 3-Bromocyclohexene
```

---

### 3. **Radical Polymerization**

Used in the formation of plastics and synthetic materials (e.g. polystyrene).

#### Phases:
1. **Initiation**: Radical from AIBN or ROOR
2. **Propagation**: Monomers like ethylene add to the radical chain
3. **Termination**: Chain ends by radical combination or disproportionation

## ðŸ”¹ Stability of Radicals

Radical stability determines reactivity and selectivity.

**Order of Stability**:
```
Allylic â‰ˆ Benzylic > 3Â° > 2Â° > 1Â° > CH3â€¢
```

**Why?**
- **Hyperconjugation** and **resonance** stabilize radicals.
- Allylic/benzylic radicals can **delocalize** the unpaired electron.

## ðŸ”¹ Radical Inhibitors

Certain substances can **terminate radicals**, stopping the chain:

| Inhibitor | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| O2       | Forms stable peroxyl radicals |
| BHT      | Donates Hâ€¢ to radicals        |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Radical Initiators

| Initiator | Trigger      | Notes                         |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Cl2, Br2  | UV light      | Used in alkane halogenation   |
| AIBN      | Heat         | Azobisisobutyronitrile, forms N2 |
| ROOR      | Heat/light   | Peroxides â†’ ROâ€¢               |

## ðŸ§  Tips for Mastering Radical Reactions

- Watch for **resonance stabilization** (especially in allylic/benzylic radicals).
- Consider **selectivity**: bromination is more selective than chlorination.
- Understand **initiation vs propagation** clearly in each mechanism.
- Know common **termination** scenarios (e.g., radical recombination).
